The following retailers, products, and so forth are currently enjoying "most favored nation" status in my garden.

## Knowledge
- [Organic! A Gardener's Handbook](http://rosalysgarden.com/node/63) - Rosaly Bass. A great primer for the novice gardener. It certainly helps that it was written specifically for our region, allowing me to directly use Rosaly's extensive experience with weather and pests. Valuable for gardeners in other regions as long as you take your seasons into account.
- [UNH Cooperative Extension](extension.unh.edu) - Your local extension office is always a good resource. Most should test your soil for a nominal charge.

## Seeds
- [High Mowing Organic Seeds](http://www.highmowingseeds.com/) - I was introduced to High Mowing through a seed-sale fundraiser at my son's school. I've since heard good things, and most of our direct-sown crop comes from here.
- [Burpee](http://www.burpee.com/) - Another reputable dealer whose seeds I got from a retail display (likely at [Shaws Supermarket](http://shaws.com)).

## Retailers

- [Achille Agway](http://achilleagway.com/) - Our local Agway store, the Achilles are friends of the family. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Most of my tools and soil amendments come from here.
- [Johnny's Selected Seeds](http://www.johnnyseeds.com/) - Recommended by Rosaly in her book, Johnny's carries nearly everything you need to establish your garden, and ships quickly (and free for orders over $200).
- [Rosaly's Garden and Farmstand](http://rosalysgarden.com/) - Located 1 mile from our homestead, Rosaly's is the oldest and largest organic farm in New Hampshire. I get my hardened-off tomato starters here.

## Misc.
- [Coast of Maine Quoddy Blend Lobster Compost](http://www.coastofmaine.com/soils-quoddy.shtml) - The only compost I've ever bought.
