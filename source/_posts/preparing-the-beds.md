After sod (and boulder) removed, did the following over several weeks:

- Removed larger rocks and roots
- Double-dig
  - Remove about 12" of topsoil
  - Use a garden fork to loosen the next 12" of substrate
  - Spread a layer of compost
  - Re-cover with topsoil
- Add soil amendments as prescribed by the extension service

Root system of former fruit trees surprisingly vast.

Only added 1 cubic foot of compost per 20 square feet of substrate (versus
recommended 1 cubic foot per 6-12 square feet). Hopefully quality of existing
soil means this isn't a mistake.

Once an entire bed (80 sq ft) had been double-dug, added the amendments
suggested by the extension service:

- 9.2 lb. dolemitic lime
- 2.4 lb. dried blood
- 1.056 lb. potash

Extension service recommended 2.88 lb. sul-po-mag (0-0-22), but Agway only had
potash (0-0-60). Hopefully calculated conversion correctly.

>> 2.88 lb @ 22% = 0.6336 lb. potassium = 1.056 lb. potash @ 60%

Dad pointed out that thick beautiful thorny shrub alive with bees and which gets
beautiful red berries in winter is likely Japanese Barberry, an invasive species
which should be removed.
