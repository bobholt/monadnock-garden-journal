- 5/15&mdash;Temp: 34&ndash;68F, Precip: 0.00"

After sod (and boulder) removed, did the following over several weeks:

- Removed larger rocks and roots
- Double-dig
  - Remove about 12" of topsoil
  - Use a garden fork to loosen the next 12" of substrate
  - Spread a layer of compost
  - Re-cover with topsoil
- Add soil amendments as prescribed by the extension service

Root system of former fruit trees surprisingly vast.

Only added 1 cubic foot of compost per 20 square feet of substrate (versus
recommended 1 cubic foot per 6-12 square feet). Hopefully quality of existing
soil means this isn't a mistake.

Once an entire bed (80 sq ft) had been double-dug, added the amendments
suggested by the extension service:

- 9.2 lb. [dolemitic lime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolomite)
- 2.4 lb. [dried blood](http://www.espoma.com/product/blood-meal/)
- 1.056 lb. [muriate of potash](http://www.fertilome.com/product.aspx?pid=2121bc21-6dc1-4b0f-830b-3bc809c97948)

Extension service recommended 2.88 lb. sul-po-mag (0-0-22), but
[Agway](achilleagway.com) only had potash (0-0-60). Hopefully calculated
conversion correctly.

> 2.88 lb @ 22% = 0.6336 lb. potassium = 1.056 lb. potash @ 60%

Dad pointed out that thick beautiful thorny shrub alive with bees and which gets
beautiful red berries in winter is likely
[Japanese Barberry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berberis_thunbergii), an
invasive species which should be removed.
