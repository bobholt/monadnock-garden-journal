Pink blossoms on tree growing in crowded SW corner of property. Search shows
this is likely [crabapple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malus) (ported over
from next door). Would love to keep crabapples and get rid of shrub.

Worried sapling within forsythia nearest driveway may have been invasive
[buckthorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhamnus_cathartica), but appears to
not be. Likely wild cherry. If so, may be worth removing forsythia.

Found maple sapling coming up in shrub on other side of driveway. If not
invasive [Norway Maple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_platanoides), may let
it stay and remove shrub.
