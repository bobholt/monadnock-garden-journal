Pink blossoms on tree growing in crowded SW corner of property. Search shows
this is likely crabapple (ported over from next door). Would love to keep
crabapples and get rid of shrub.

Worried sapling within forsythia nearest driveway may have been invasive
buckthorn, but appears not to be. Likely wild cherry. If so, may be worth
removing forsythia.

Found maple sapling coming up in shrub on other side of driveway. If not
invasive Norway Maple, may let that stay and remove shrub.
