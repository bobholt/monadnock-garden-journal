Ordered 80 cinder blocks yesterday to form garden bed perimeters, hopefully to
better retain soil. Arrived today. Malcolm gathered existing rocks from
do-nothing border while I hauled blocks across the yard and placed. We make a
good team.

Attended a lilac pruning workshop at
[The Monadnock Center for History and Culture](http://monadnockcenter.org/).
Presenter was A.J. Dupere from NH Forests and Lands
[Urban Forestry Center](http://www.nhdfl.org/land-conservation/urban-forestry-center/).
Extremely knowledgeable and patient. I feel ready to tackle our lilacs (and
other spring-flowering shrubs like forsythia and pussy willow).

Dupere also recommended resources for identifying trees (and distinguishing
between Norway and Sugar maples):

- [Forest Trees of Maine](http://www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/publications/handbooks_guides/forest_trees/index.html)
