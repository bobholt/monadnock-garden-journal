It's been a warm few days.

Put lilac pruning class into practice. Clearing tons of overgrown areas (will
probably be around 500 sq ft total) and pruning lilacs and forsythia.

Pretty much definite to take down shrubs closest to either side of driveway.

Brush pile in driveway continues to grow. Hopefully ready to be picked up and
chipped by end of next week.
