We're going to have a garden. Planning on 2 4'x20' beds (total of 160 square
feet). Plenty of greens, and we'll try our hands at warm-weather crops like okra
(Mia's choice) and watermelon (Malcolm's).

Sent soil samples for areas of the yard where we hope to plant

 - Vegetable Garden
 - Berry Bushes
 - Trees
 - Flowers/Shrubs

to [UNH Cooperative Extension](http://extension.unh.edu) today.

Results should take 2-3 weeks.
