This year, we're starting some seeds indoors. Last year was an experiment in
figuring out what we could grow by direct-seeding (except for some tomato
starters we purchased and some kale we were given). It mostly worked well, with
some exception.

Apparently the first thing we needed to start, though, was our onions, and that
should have been around February 1. What're you gonna do?

I started 72 seeds of
[Dakota Tears](http://www.highmowingseeds.com/organic-non-gmo-seeds-Dakota-Tears-Onion.html)
onions from High Mowing Organic Seeds in moistened
[Pro-Mix Organic Seed Starting Mix](http://www.promixfindgrowtopia.com/product/detail/pro-mix-ultimate-organic-seed-starting-mix/).
I barely pressed them into the soil and dusted another thin coating of the soil
mix over them.

We keep the house at 65&deg; during the day and it drops to 55&ndash;60&deg; at
night.
