Rained last night briefly and a little harder (but just as brief) today.

Received [dual tumbler composter](http://www.goodideasinc.com/products/composters/compost-wizard-dual-senior/)
ordered on 15 April.

Cleared forsythia near garden to make a space for it. Also dug out a nasty
thorny vine growing in there. Going to fight forsythia back on all fronts and
try to take down some vertical height to keep it out of utility lines.
