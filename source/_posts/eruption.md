I think what we've got here are some good seeds, and what we're seeing is the
first eruption of the root from the seed coat, about 3 days after planting the
seeds. I pretty much just pressed the seeds into the top of the soil and covered
with a light dusting of additional soil, so this looks like the root searching
for purchase.

Cool.
