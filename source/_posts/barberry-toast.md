Watered this morning. Need better barrier around beds (possibly cinder block),
as soil seems to be quite erosion-prone. Will bag next lawn-mowing and use as
mulch.

Hopefully eradicated majority of Japanese Barberry in yard. Removed huge shrub
(and pulled roots) in front yard. Found more in dense growth in back yard on
either side of property line. Cut off at ground and pulled out.
