Mowed lawn for first time yesterday. 4" mower height. Uncovered tons of wild
strawberries in bloom (in addition to existing white and purple violets and
dandelions).

Today, planted 9 tomato plants (Viva Italia Plum Tomatoes from Rosaly Bass) over
20 square feet (18" separation).

Also planted 16 square feet of kale (White Russian) seeds.
