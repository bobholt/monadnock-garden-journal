No rain today. Maybe tomorrow?

Double-dug 40 sq ft of the second planting bed, which will hold beans, okra,
onions, garlic, zucchini and watermelons. Each 20 sq ft section seems to have
its own characteristics. Front bed had:

1. Tons of fruit tree roots
2. Soil clumped with spidery roots
3. Really easy
4. Giant damn rock

Today's digging uncovered:

1. Tons of basketball-sized rocks
2. More spidery roots clumping soil together

I've been generally double-digging in 20 sq ft per-day increments. Today's 40
was too much, especially with temps in the 80s.
