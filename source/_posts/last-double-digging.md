- 5/27&mdash;Temp: 62&ndash;86F, Precip: 0.18"

Finished the last 40 sq ft of the last bed. Done double-digging for this season.

Did all 40 today, but split first 20 before work, and second 20 after. Follow up
each with a dose of ibuprofen and a shower, and I don't feel it at all.

The last sections yielded lots of fruit tree roots and softball-sized rocks. A
couple of doozies (100+ lb) thrown in there for good measure.

Thunderstorm coming tonight (now). So far not much rain, but a couple of hours
left of the big stuff. Should shower through tomorrow. Planning on finishing
planting Friday.

Geraniums not looking so hot.
