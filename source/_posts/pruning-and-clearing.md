Rained yesterday. Garden soil still damp through today.

Started clearing barberry from corner crabapple area. Ended up clearing
everything from that area except crabapple, including another semi-invasive that
is also used as a shrubbery elsewhere in the yard and another few cherry-like
saplings. Also pruned several branches from crabapple to allow it to grown more
sustainably.

Nice ground cover in vicinity. We'll see if it survives after we stole its
shade.
